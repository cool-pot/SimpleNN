# SimpleNN

**SimpleNN** is a **S**imple **N**eural **N**etwork implementation in the idea 
of computational graph using pure python3. 

Similar to **TensorFlow**, the graph nodes represent mathematical operations, while 
the graph edges represent the data arrays (numpy) that flow between them. This repo 
is for academic usage only, no guarantee, although will try, for performance and accuracy.


## Acknowledge 
This computation graph framework was designed by
Philipp Meerkamp, Pierre Garapon, and David Rosenberg. This is a python3 implementation
by Yi Zhou after taking David Rosenberg's DS-GA 1003 Machine Learning Course at NYU Data
Science Center and for the sake of CS-GY 6643 Computer Vision Project.
